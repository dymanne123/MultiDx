A 30-year-old man presented with several months of pain, tenderness, and swelling on the left side of his palate. On examination, the left palatine mucosa was diffusely swollen—most pronounced in the molar region—with poorly defined borders and increased pain on palpation. T2-weighted MRI demonstrated a high-signal-intensity lesion in that area. Panoramic radiography and CT scans of the maxilla and sinuses were unremarkable, and all left maxillary teeth appeared healthy. His medical and family histories were unremarkable, and he denied any history of trauma or inflammation in the head or neck. Empiric treatment with oral antibiotics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for 7 days produced no improvement. Based on the clinical and radiographic findings, a soft-tissue tumor was suspected, and an incisional biopsy was performed.

<think>
1. Infection or inflammation was considered given the pain and swelling—“we administered antibiotics orally … and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs … for 7 days … however, his symptoms did not improve.”
2. Mucosal neuroma was considered because of the potential for many nerve bundles—“mucosal neuromas resemble traumatic neuromas because of the presence of many nerve bundles … However, the absence of inflammatory cells in a normal or loose fibrous connective tissue background can lead to the diagnosis of a mucosal neuroma.”
3. Neurofibroma was considered due to a fibrous connective tissue background—“neurofibromas have mast cells and nuclei with a wavy or serpiginous prolife, and do not contain the abundant, haphazardly arranged axons that are unique to traumatic neuromas.”
4. Palisading neuroma was considered in view of nerve bundle formation—“the absence of inflammatory cells and fibrous connective tissue and the existence of spindle cells showing palisading arrangement and generally circumscribed margin is more indicative of a palisading neuroma.”
5. Neurovascular hamartoma was considered because of combined nerve and vessel components—“neurovascular hamartomas are unique histologically because their neural and vascular components are separate, with a dominant neural component.”

A 27-year-old left-hand–dominant man presented with bilateral clicking and discomfort of several years’ duration, localized to the anterior aspects of both elbows and slowly worsening despite simple analgesia and physiotherapy. He reported intermittent paraesthesia in the forearms, particularly after physical activity. Symptoms were exacerbated by pull-ups and heavy lifting at work. He was otherwise healthy. On examination, both elbows had a full range of motion, with no instability or weakness. Grip and grind tests were negative bilaterally. There was no objective sensory disturbance, and Tinel’s sign was negative. The hook test for distal biceps rupture was negative, and provocative testing of the biceps produced no pain. While moving the left elbow, a palpable click over the lateral biceps tendon reduced with digital pressure. Plain radiographs and MRI of both elbows revealed no pathology. The decision was made to perform surgical exploration of the right elbow.
----------------------------------------
OUTPUT
----------------------------------------
<think>
1. Biceps tendinopathy — “provocative testing of the biceps produced no pain.”
2. Partial-thickness tear of the distal biceps tendon — “hook test for distal biceps rupture was negative.”
3. Brachialis tendinitis — “Grip and grind tests were negative for pain bilaterally.”
4. Capsular strain — “Examination revealed the full range of movement of both elbows with no instability or weakness.”
5. Pronator syndrome — “There was no objective sensory disturbance, and Tinel’s sign was negative.”
6. Gout — “Plain imaging and MRI scans of both elbows did not reveal any pathology.”
7. Arthritis — “Plain imaging and MRI scans of both elbows did not reveal any pathology.”
8. Radial tunnel syndrome — “Plain imaging and MRI scans of both elbows did not reveal any pathology.”
9. Lateral epicondylitis — “Plain imaging and MRI scans of both elbows did not reveal any pathology.”
10. C6 radiculopathy — “There was no objective sensory disturbance, and Tinel’s sign was negative.”

A 75-year-old woman, gravida 2, postmenopausal for many years, presented with vaginal bleeding of one week’s duration. She had a history of hyperlipidemia managed medically. Laboratory studies showed a CA 19-9 level of 9.8 U/mL, a CA-125 level of 13.5 U/mL, and a serum glucose concentration of 118 mg/dL. Contrast-enhanced abdominal and pelvic computed tomography revealed a multiseptated cystic mass in the left adnexa, adherent to the left psoas muscle and adjacent small and large bowel loops, with a possibility of an underlying chronic inflammatory process or abscess. Under the impression of a possible mucinous cystadenoma, the patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy.
----------------------------------------
OUTPUT
----------------------------------------
<think>
1. Mucinous cystadenoma was the preoperative concern — “To rule out mucinous cyst adenoma, we executed exploratory laparotomy.”
2. Abscess or chronic inflammatory process was suggested by imaging — “there is possibility of underlying chronic inflammatory process with abscess.”
3. Serous carcinoma was considered because psammoma bodies in endosalpingiosis can mimic malignancy — “Endosalpingiosis is associated with the formation of psammoma bodies, which may lead to the misdiagnosis of malignancy such as serous carcinoma.”
4. Metastatic adenocarcinoma was in the pathological differential because endosalpingiosis can appear in lymph nodes — “Endosalpingiosis is occasionally found in lymph nodes, and may be misinterpreted as an adenocarcinoma metastasis.”
5. Endometriosis was excluded by the absence of hemorrhage around the epithelium — “Unlike endometriosis, it is not associated with hemorrhage.”
6. A tubal-type epithelial proliferation with endometrial stroma would indicate endometriosis rather than endosalpingiosis — “A tubal-type epithelial surrounded by endometrial-type stroma is a variant of endometriosis, not endosalpingiosis.”

A 78-year-old man was admitted with three days of diffuse abdominal pain, obstipation, nausea, and vomiting. He had no significant medical history. On examination, his temperature was 37.2 °C, pulse 88 beats/min, blood pressure 130/75 mm Hg, and respiratory rate 18 breaths/min. His abdomen was distended and diffusely tender, without peritoneal signs. Laboratory tests showed WBC 5560/mm3, hemoglobin 11.8 g/dL, platelets 252 000/mm3, glucose 99 mg/dL, AST 15 U/L, ALT 15 U/L, creatinine 1.17 mg/dL, and urea 40 mg/dL.
Abdominal radiography demonstrated hydroaerial levels in the right abdomen and hypogastrium. Ultrasound noted marked aerocolia in the colon but no free fluid. Contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed marked distension of small and large bowel with pneumatosis up to the hepatic flexure, where a 10 mm focal thickening of the bowel wall was noted. A clinical diagnosis of large-bowel obstruction due to a stenosing colonic lesion was made.
An emergency laparotomy identified a firm, stenosing mass at the hepatic flexure causing obstruction. A right hemicolectomy with ileotransverse anastomosis was performed, and the specimen was sent for histopathological analysis.
----------------------------------------
OUTPUT
----------------------------------------
<think>
1. Colorectal adenocarcinoma was suspected given the patient’s age and a stenosing mass on imaging — “stenosing mass located in the hepatic angle of the ascending colon” — but was excluded because “no invasive dysplastic or neoplastic stigmata were identified.”
2. Miliary tuberculosis was considered in the macroscopic differential of granulomatous colonic lesions but was excluded as “Neither areas of necrosis, nor viable microorganisms were detected.”
3. Crohn’s disease was part of the macroscopic differential due to possible transmural inflammation — “The differential diagnosis after macroscopic examination may include: … Crohn’s disease” — but lacked the typical granulomas and skip lesions on histology.
4. Whipple disease was considered among microscopic mimickers — “Microscopically, the malakoplakia may be similar to: the Whipple disease, …” — yet the characteristic Michaelis-Gutmann bodies were present rather than periodic acid-Schiff–positive Tropheryma whipplei inclusions.
5. Other granulomatous disorders (e.g., sarcoidosis, ceroid-like histiocytosis) were considered but were ruled out by the pathognomonic presence of Michaelis-Gutmann bodies — “The most distinctive histological feature for the diagnostic of malakoplakia is represented by the Michaelis-Gutmann bodies.”

A 14‐year‐old Caucasian male presented for a routine orthodontic assessment. On panoramic radiography, there was a well‐defined, homogeneous radiopaque spherical mass measuring 1.5 × 1 cm at the apex of the right maxillary permanent canine. A lateral cephalometric radiograph localized the lesion superior to the canine fossa and anterior to the anterior wall of the maxillary sinus. Review of an orthopantomogram taken at age 10 showed no such lesion. The patient reported a history of facial acne vulgaris since age 12, successfully treated by dermatology. On extraoral examination the overlying skin was intact and acne‐free; the mass was palpable and mobile but not visible. Facial profile and contour were normal. Orthodontic evaluation revealed a Class III incisor relationship on a Class III skeletal base with maxillary crowding. No other abnormalities were noted.

1. Dystrophic calcinosis cutis is suggested by local tissue damage from acne with normal systemic mineral levels — “Dystrophic calcinosis cutis occurs in areas of tissue damage secondary to infection, inflammatory processes... without any alteration to calcium or phosphate metabolism, for example, in AV.”
2. Metastatic calcification is unlikely because it requires systemic disturbances of calcium or phosphate — “Metastatic calcification is due to changes in the metabolism of calcium or phosphate, which leads to precipitation of calcium in the skin.”
3. Idiopathic calcification is less likely since idiopathic lesions arise without preexisting tissue damage — “Idiopathic calcification arises without any underlying tissue damage or metabolic disorder...”
4. Iatrogenic calcification is improbable in the absence of prior interventions or trauma — “Iatrogenic calcification is secondary to medical interventions which can damage tissue or lead to disturbances in calcium and phosphate metabolism.”
5. Osteoma cutis involves true bone formation rather than calcium salt deposition — “While dystrophic calcinosis cutis results in calcification of areas in the skin, osteoma cutis causes ossification of the dermis and subcutaneous tissue...”
6. Calcified lymph nodes or cysts and caseous granulomas are potential considerations but are less consistent with a solitary dermal lesion following acne — “Differential diagnoses include osteoma cutis, calcified lymph nodes or cysts, and areas of calcified necrotic materials such as caseous granulomas in tuberculosis.”
