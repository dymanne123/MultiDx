CASE PRESENTATION
----------------------------------------
A 30-year-old man presented with several months of pain, tenderness, and swelling on the left side of his palate. On examination, the left palatine mucosa was diffusely swollen—most pronounced in the molar region—with poorly defined borders and increased pain on palpation. T2-weighted MRI demonstrated a high-signal-intensity lesion in that area. Panoramic radiography and CT scans of the maxilla and sinuses were unremarkable, and all left maxillary teeth appeared healthy. His medical and family histories were unremarkable, and he denied any history of trauma or inflammation in the head or neck. Empiric treatment with oral antibiotics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for 7 days produced no improvement. Based on the clinical and radiographic findings, a soft-tissue tumor was suspected, and an incisional biopsy was performed.

<think>
1. Infection or inflammation was considered given the pain and swelling—“we administered antibiotics orally … and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs … for 7 days … however, his symptoms did not improve.”
2. Mucosal neuroma was considered because of the potential for many nerve bundles—“mucosal neuromas resemble traumatic neuromas because of the presence of many nerve bundles … However, the absence of inflammatory cells in a normal or loose fibrous connective tissue background can lead to the diagnosis of a mucosal neuroma.”
3. Neurofibroma was considered due to a fibrous connective tissue background—“neurofibromas have mast cells and nuclei with a wavy or serpiginous prolife, and do not contain the abundant, haphazardly arranged axons that are unique to traumatic neuromas.”
4. Palisading neuroma was considered in view of nerve bundle formation—“the absence of inflammatory cells and fibrous connective tissue and the existence of spindle cells showing palisading arrangement and generally circumscribed margin is more indicative of a palisading neuroma.”
5. Neurovascular hamartoma was considered because of combined nerve and vessel components—“neurovascular hamartomas are unique histologically because their neural and vascular components are separate, with a dominant neural component.”
